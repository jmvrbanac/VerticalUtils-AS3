Author: John Vrbanac

This package is a collection of ActionScript 3 utility classes

 - PropertyLibrary <br />
 The property library is designed to be a simple data repository
 for all data types. Currently, it only provides a method for
 getting/setting individual values. In the future, you'll be
 able to retrieve entire categories of data values.
 
 - AdvancedSprite <br />
 The AdvancedSprite is an alternative sprite base class that 
 allows for easier cleanup for garbage collection.
